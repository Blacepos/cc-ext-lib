# ComputerCraft Extended Standard Library

Contains some useful abstractions over the base ComputerCraft (specifically, [CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/)) APIs. Includes modules for navigation, logging, and refueling, as well as some basic extensions to Lua. 

This library was developed using [lua-language-server](https://github.com/luals/lua-language-server) and all modules are typed with its [LuaCATS](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) syntax.
